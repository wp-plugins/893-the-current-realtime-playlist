Displays the song currently being played on 89.3 The Current.
== Description ==

Project home is [scaredpanda.com](http://scaredpanda.com/893-the-current-playlist-widget/ "89.3 The Current Realtime Playlist").

The Current is an independent music station in Minneapolis that I listen to all the time. It is part of Minnesota Public Radio and broadcasts an eclectic music format of independent artists and a solid rotation of songs by local artists. The station is comparable to KEXP in Seattle and WOXY in Cincinnati.

The widget uses an XMLHttpRequest to checked against the Current’s web service. This Interval can be configured in the getplaylist.php page. The widget will automatically update itself with the most current song being played, since its using a javascript ajax call the page does not need to be refreshed to see the updated song.

Simply activate the plug in and choose where on your site the plug in should live. Once the the plug in has been actived the current song should be displayed with a link to The Currents "Now Playing" page

This is the first version of this widget so please email me with any questions/comments/bugs that you come across.
== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder "thecurrent-realtime-playlist" to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress

== Troubleshooting == 

If the plug in does not initially work work; try the following:

- Open the playlist.php file and check the “helperFilePath” variable. The “helperFilePath” variable should have a value that is the same location as the plugin folder on your site.
